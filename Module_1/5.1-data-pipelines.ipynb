    "Suppose you're a decision maker in the engineering team at an eCommerce company which currently generates millions of dollars in net revenue. You have a legacy system that sits on company's data centers in remote locations, away from the headquarter where your office is. The engineering team and the data analytics team have made the decision that they would like to build a search engine, recommendation engine, and few other engines that require heavy machine learning models to increase the revenue for the company. As a decision maker, you need to assess the current system, and the engineering requirement for the future fiscal years. So you decide to answer some questions and prepare answers for the next leadership meeting.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, the capability of the data center is limited based on the square footage of the location, as well as the hardware that can be stored in the square footage. The data center resource is not only shared in the engineering team, but also within the supply chain team, logistics, HR's IT platform, and also with some other internal operations, like marketing, leadership, and also analytics team. The data centers have maxed out in terms of the hardware that they can support, and may be in need of expanding and opening up another data center."

    "\"\"\"1. Cost Savings\n",
    "\n",
    "\t•\tReduced Hardware Costs: No need for maintaining or purchasing physical servers, which reduces capital expenditure.\n",
    "\t•\tPay-as-you-go Model: Only pay for what you use, avoiding overprovisioning.\n",
    "\t•\tEnergy Efficiency: Lower energy consumption since you are not running physical infrastructure in-house.\n",
    "\t•\tMaintenance Reduction: Cloud providers handle hardware upkeep, leading to fewer in-house IT maintenance costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Human Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "\t•\tLess IT Overhead: Internal teams can focus on innovation rather than maintaining infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Scalability\n",
    "\n",
    "\t•\tElastic Resources: Easily scale up or down based on demand, avoiding the risk of under or over-provisioning.\n",
    "\t•\tGlobal Reach: If the business expands, cloud infrastructure can be accessed globally with minimal latency issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Disaster Recovery\n",
    "\n",
    "\t•\tHigh Availability and Reliability: Built-in redundancy across data centers for backups and failovers, reducing the risk of downtime.\n",
    "\t•\tBackup and Recovery: Easier and faster recovery options, minimizing potential data loss and recovery times.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "\t•\tImproved Speed: Cloud services often outperform on-premise infrastructure in terms of speed and reliability.\n",
    "\t•\tAccess to AI Tools: Cloud environments provide access to AI, machine learning, and analytics tools that might be cost-prohibitive to implement on-premise.\n",

    "# Cons of Migrating to the Cloud:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\" 1. Migration\n",
    "\n",
    "\t•\tMigration Costs: Initial expenses may be high due to data transfer, new architecture, and potential refactoring of applications.\n",
    "\t•\tTraining Costs: Teams may require additional training to operate in a cloud environment, which involves an upfront investment.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Human Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "\t•\tSkill Gap: Not all IT staff may have cloud experience, requiring either hiring or retraining, which could slow down the migration.\n",
    "\t•\tResistance to Change: Employees might resist the move if they are accustomed to on-premise infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Ongoing Operational Costs\n",
    "\n",
    "\t•\tUncontrolled Spending: If not managed well, cloud usage can result in unpredictable and higher-than-expected costs due to scaling and additional services.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Security Concerns\n",
    "\n",
    "\t•\tData Privacy and Compliance: Depending on your cloud provider, data privacy and compliance could be more challenging, especially in regulated industries (e.g., healthcare).\n",
    "\t•\tThird-party Risks: Entrusting data to third-party vendors introduces new security risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Performance Uncertainty\n",
    "\n",
    "\t•\tLatency Issues: Some cloud applications may suffer from latency issues depending on geographic location or bandwidth.\n",
